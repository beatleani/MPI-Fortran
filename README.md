# MPI-Fortran
Given a 512 x 512 x 512 grid of data points, it naturally takes a lot of time to run it sequentially. Here, I've devised a code in Fortran, written in MPI to parallelize the sequential program in order to reduce the time taken for computation.
The plot is also submitted where the time taken is on the Y-axis and the number of processors is on the X-axis.
